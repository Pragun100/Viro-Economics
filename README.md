# Viro-Economics
Repository of code used while building my project for HooHacks 2020. This project was created to provide the public with a comprehensive overview of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and how they may be personally affected. In this pursuit, I have developed a webpage, as well as an interactive dashboard to summarize important information. I hope to continuously update my project after it is graded by HooHacks judges with relevant economic information as this pandemic unfolds. 

### Webpage:
https://viro-economics.herokuapp.com/

This webpage was built using Flask, HTML, and CSS. The Flask app is included in the repo as "app.py"

### Dashboard:
https://vir-econ-dash.herokuapp.com/

This dashboard was created using Dash, a python plotting library built off JavaScript. My dashboard includes calls to the Yahoo Finance API to collect time-series data on the S&P 500 since the beginning of 2019. The dashboard also includes a stimulus payment calculator for those who would like to see how much they will receive in the coming weeks as a result of the new economic stimulus bill. I hope to add more useful graphics in the future.
